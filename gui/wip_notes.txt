This gui was only half way to the prototype
version, so has many parts not fully working.

The main idea is to have a user select segments
already made by SIC/MSLIC and clustered by other
methods and correct misclassifications. The
ability to select a cluster grtaphically was
made via tkinter and matplotlib, however the
infrastructure to save these selection and then
extract useful information from them is still to
be implemented.

My main advice would be to take this as a 
suggestion for what should be made rather
than a starting point.

WARNING: tkinter only ever loads if you call
the python file from command line as most
IDEs either use it or disable it.
